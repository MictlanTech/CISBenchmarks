# CISBenchmarks
+ **CIS (Center for Internet Security)** is an organization that provides a set of best practices and security configuration guidelines for various software, operating systems, and network devices. 
+ CIS Benchmarks are detailed documents that outline recommended security settings and configurations to help organizations secure their IT systems and infrastructure.
+ These guidelines are regularly updated to address emerging security threats and vulnerabilities.

## Automation of Configuration Management for Compliance with CIS Benchmarks:
:robot: Automating configuration management to comply with CIS Benchmarks makes sense for several reasons:

+ **Consistency and Accuracy:** Manual configuration of IT systems can lead to human errors, inconsistencies, and oversights. Automation ensures that configurations are applied consistently and accurately across all relevant devices, reducing the risk of misconfigurations that could be exploited by attackers.
+ **Efficiency:** Automation can significantly reduce the time and effort required to apply CIS Benchmark recommendations. It allows for rapid deployment of configurations and can quickly adapt to changes in the environment.
+ **Continuous Compliance:** IT environments are dynamic, with systems and software being added, updated, and removed regularly. Automated configuration management tools can continuously monitor and enforce compliance with CIS Benchmarks, ensuring that systems remain secure even as they evolve.
+ **Timeliness:** Security threats evolve rapidly, and CIS Benchmarks are updated to address new vulnerabilities. Automation can help organizations stay up-to-date with the latest security best practices by automatically applying the latest recommended configurations.
+ **Auditing and Reporting:** Automated tools can generate detailed audit logs and reports, which are essential for demonstrating compliance with CIS Benchmarks to auditors and regulatory authorities.
+ **Scalability:** As organizations grow, manual configuration management becomes increasingly impractical. Automation scales easily to manage configurations across a large number of systems efficiently.
